# HyperCycle Fleet Validator Operations

End-to-end validator lifecycle on HyperCycle HyperAIBox edge nodes: fleet discovery → readiness audit → bundle deployment → `.env` configuration → container startup → peer mesh wiring → Stargate UI integration.

## Pre-conditions
- SSH access to target nodes as `hyperai` user (key-based auth preferred).
- Battery validator install bundle cloned locally (or access to `Battery-Movement/batteryagi-validator-install`).
- Offline Docker image tar (`batteryagid-v0.1.0-linux-arm64.tar`) available for nodes that cannot pull from GHCR.
- Tailscale mesh active between nodes (for cross-node P2P).

## Phase 1 — Fleet Discovery

1. Ping sweep the known LAN range (`192.168.0.0/24`) for live HyperAIBox nodes.
2. Confirm each node responds to SSH and collect basic facts:
   ```bash
   ssh hyperai@<IP> "uname -m; docker --version; docker compose version; df -h /; ntpq -p || chronyc tracking"
   ```
3. Record node identity (moniker), LAN IP, Tailscale IP, and hardware profile (e.g. RK3588).

## Phase 2 — Readiness Audit (per node)

| Check | Command | Pass Criteria |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Architecture | `uname -m` | `aarch64` |
| Docker Engine | `docker --version` | v28+ installed |
| Docker Compose | `docker compose version` | v2 plugin present |
| Disk | `df -h /` | ≥20 GB free (alert at 95%) |
| Ports | `ss -tlnp` | 26656, 26657, 1317, 9090 not bound by others |
| NTP | `ntpq -p` or `chronyc tracking` | Synchronized |

**Pitfall:** If disk is >95% full, stop and clean up before proceeding. Typical reclaim targets: old Docker images (`docker images`), builder cache (`docker builder prune -af`), inference AIM tarballs, and rotated logs.

## Phase 3 — Bundle Deployment

1. Clone or refresh the install bundle locally.
2. Verify genesis integrity against `genesis.sha256`:
   ```bash
   sha256sum genesis/genesis.json
   cat genesis/genesis.sha256
   ```
3. `rsync` bundle to node `~/batterycoin-validator/` (exclude `.git` to save space).
4. Load Docker image from offline tar:
   ```bash
   ssh hyperai@<IP> "cd ~/batterycoin-validator && docker load -i image/batteryagid-v0.1.0-linux-arm64.tar"
   ```

## Phase 4 — Per-Node Configuration

Create a `.env` from `validator.env.example` with these required fields:

| Var | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `MONIKER` | Unique per node (e.g. `batteryagi-validator-1`) |
| `CHAIN_ID` | `batterycoin-1` |
| `BATTERYAGI_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS` | Node's Tailscale IP + `:26656` |
| `BATTERYAGI_PERSISTENT_PEERS` | Comma-separated `id@tailscale-ip:26656` of **other** validators |
| `BATTERYAGI_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/battery-movement/batterycoin-node:v0.1.0` |
| `GENESIS_SHA256` | Canonical SHA-256 of `genesis.json` |

**Pitfall:** Do NOT set `PERSISTENT_PEERS` to include the node's own address. The entrypoint script (`/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh`) reads `.env` and rewrites `config.toml` at startup. If `MONIKER` is wrong, run `batteryagid init <moniker> --chain-id <chain-id>` **inside** the container to regenerate config dirs.

## Phase 5 — Container Lifecycle

```bash
# Start
ssh hyperai@<IP> "cd ~/batterycoin-validator && docker compose -f compose.validator.yaml up -d"

# Check health
ssh hyperai@<IP> "docker ps | grep batteryagi-validator"
ssh hyperai@<IP> "curl -s http://127.0.0.1:26657/status | python3 -c 'import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); r=d.get(\"result\",{}); print(\"Peers:\",r.get(\"n_peers\"),\"Moniker:\",r.get(\"node_info\",{}).get(\"moniker\"),\"Height:\",r.get(\"sync_info\",{}).get(\"latest_block_height\"))'"
```

**Critical:** If you change the compose port binding (e.g. from `127.0.0.1:26657` to `0.0.0.0:26657` for LAN polling), a `docker compose restart` is **insufficient** — the container must be recreated:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.validator.yaml down && docker compose -f compose.validator.yaml up -d
```

## Phase 6 — Peer Mesh Verification

After both validators are running, verify bidirectional P2P:

```bash
# On each node, check peer count
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:26657/net_info | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["n_peers"])'

# Cross-node reachability (from any node)
timeout 5 bash -c 'echo > /dev/tcp/<OTHER_TAILSCALE_IP>/26656' && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
```

Each validator should report `n_peers = N-1` for an N-node mesh. For a 2-node mesh, expect `1`; for 3-node, expect `2`.

### Adding a 3rd-Party Validator (e.g. Mike's node)

When a new validator is operated by someone else, their box may be on a **different Tailscale tailnet**. Tailscale IPs (`100.x.x.x`) do not route across tailnets.

1. **Have the owner share their node** into your tailnet:
   ```bash
   # On Mike's HyperAIBox
   sudo tailscale share 100.72.251.124 mauricio240887@gmail.com
   ```
2. **Verify reachability** from your existing validators:
   ```bash
   ssh hyperai@192.168.0.150 "ping -c 1 100.72.251.124"
   ```
3. **Update `BATTERYAGI_PERSISTENT_PEERS` on ALL validators** to include the new node:
   | Box | Updated `BATTERYAGI_PERSISTENT_PEERS` |
   |-----|--------------------------------------|
   | C-3PO | `100.94.115.120:26656,100.72.251.124:26656` |
   | R2-D2 | `100.92.116.49:26656,100.72.251.124:26656` |
   | Mike  | `100.92.116.49:26656,100.94.115.120:26656` |
4. **Recreate containers** on all boxes (not just restart):
   ```bash
   ssh hyperai@<IP> "cd ~/batterycoin-validator && docker compose -f compose.validator.yaml down && docker compose -f compose.validator.yaml up -d"
   ```
5. **Verify full mesh:** every box reports `n_peers = N-1`.

**Reference:** `references/tailnet-peering-for-multi-party-meshes.md` for full details.

## Phase 7 — Stargate UI Integration

### 7a — Direct Validator Polling (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL:** `EnhancedLocalNodeBridge.getTelemetry().validatorPool` is **always null** for remote validators. The bridge only tracks the local Node Manager (`localhost:8006`), which has zero knowledge of CometBFT containers running on other nodes. Any UI that reads `validatorPool` from the bridge will show **0 validators online** even when all nodes are healthy.

**Correct pattern:** Poll CometBFT `/status` directly from the dashboard host to each validator's RPC port, then supplement with `/net_info` for peer count:

```typescript
const DEFAULT_VALIDATOR_ENDPOINTS = [
  { id: 'c3po', name: 'C-3PO', host: '192.168.0.150', rpcPort: 26657, network: 'batterycoin-1' },
  { id: 'r2d2', name: 'R2-D2', host: '192.168.0.38',  rpcPort: 26657, network: 'batterycoin-1' },
];

async function fetchStatus(endpoint) {
  const base = `http://${endpoint.host}:${endpoint.rpcPort}`;
  // 1. /status — moniker, height, sync state
  const statusRes = await fetch(`${base}/status`, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(3000) });
  const statusData = await statusRes.json();
  const syncInfo = statusData.result.sync_info;
  const nodeInfo = statusData.result.node_info;

  // 2. /net_info — peer count (NOT present in /status)
  const netRes = await fetch(`${base}/net_info`, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(3000) });
  const netData = await netRes.json();
  const nPeers = netData?.result?.n_peers ?? 0;

  return {
    id: endpoint.id,
    name: nodeInfo.moniker,
    status: syncInfo.catching_up ? 'catching_up' : 'synced',
    blockHeight: parseInt(syncInfo.latest_block_height, 10),
    peerCount: nPeers,
    network: endpoint.network,
  };
}
```

**Pitfall:** `/status` does NOT contain `n_peers`. CometBFT splits peer count across a separate endpoint. If you only poll `/status`, peer count will always be `0` even when nodes are fully meshed.

**Reference:** `references/telemetry-direct-polling.md` for full hook + badge implementation.

### 7b — Battery Dashboard Cross-Verification Pattern

When partnering with a team that operates the same validators (e.g. Battery AGI), establish a read-only JSON feed so both dashboards consume the **same source of truth**:

```
Battery Dashboard polls validators → exposes GET /api/runtime/cosmos/validator-pool?format=stargate
                                                              ↓
Mosaic Companion Battery Pool consumes this feed instead of direct polling
```

Benefits:
- Single canonical data source eliminates drift between dashboards
- Battery's dashboard shows origin-of-truth (they run the nodes)
- Mosaic shows cross-verification view (operator view)
- Both dashboards scale automatically as validators 3–5 come online

**Prerequisite:** Battery's dashboard machine must be on the same Tailscale tailnet as the validator boxes, or the boxes must be shared via `tailscale share <ip> user@partner.com`.

### 7c — Registry-Based Pool Architecture

For the Stargate Pool tab, use a registry-driven architecture instead of monolithic god-files:

- `pools/types.ts` — `PoolDefinition`, `PoolProps`, `PoolStatus`
- `pools/registry.ts` — Array of pools; each pool registers its component + live badge
- `StargatePoolHub.tsx` — Orchestrator: selector grid ↔ detail view
- `PoolConfigModal.tsx` — Per-pool settings overlay

Adding a new partner pool requires only **one component file + one registry entry** — no changes to `AdaPortalPanel.tsx`.

### 7c — Build Verification

```bash
cd /home/mauricio/mosaic-companion
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run build       # vite build
```

Both must pass before declaring the integration complete.

## Pitfalls

- **Bridge telemetry does NOT include remote validators.** `EnhancedLocalNodeBridge.getTelemetry().validatorPool` is null for CometBFT containers running on other nodes. Always poll `/status` directly from the dashboard host. See `references/telemetry-direct-polling.md`.
- **Disk:** R2D2-type nodes often carry large inference AIM images. Always audit disk before deployment.
- **Port binding:** Compose file defaults bind RPC to `127.0.0.1`. For LAN/dashboard polling, change to `0.0.0.0` and recreate the container.
- **Genesis mismatch:** Wrong `GENESIS_SHA256` causes the container to enter a restart loop. Always verify against `genesis.sha256` in the bundle.
- **Duplicate validator address:** The bundle ships a single `keyring-test/validator` key. Multiple nodes using the same key will share the same validator address. Acceptable for dev/test meshes; rotate keys before mainnet.
- **Import cleanup:** When moving `StargatePoolDashboard` between tabs, ensure the import is present in `AdaPortalPanel.tsx` for the tab that renders it, and removed from the old tab to avoid duplication.
- **Cross-tailnet IP translation:** When a node is shared via `tailscale share`, Tailscale assigns a **different 100.x IP** in the recipient's tailnet than the owner's tailnet. E.g. C-3PO is `100.92.116.49` in `mauricio240887@` but `100.92.116.48` in `junglemikesartandprints@`. If a validator's `.env` contains IPs from the wrong tailnet namespace, outbound connections will fail with `connected=False` even though the ports are open. Always use the IPs visible in `tailscale status` on the **dialer's** machine, not the **owner's**. See `references/cross-tailnet-ip-verification.md` for the verification protocol and `references/native-cometbft-operations.md` for the owner-vs-recipient distinction.
- **Bogus IP trap:** External collaborators may mention IP addresses that do not actually exist on the network (e.g. `100.106.25.34`). Always verify with `ping`, `python3 socket.connect_ex`, or `curl` before updating `.env`. A non-routable IP in persistent_peers causes `n_peers` to drop silently with no error in logs.
- **Native CometBFT UFW pitfall:** When switching from Docker scaffold to native CometBFT (outside Docker), UFW host-level firewall rules suddenly apply because Docker bridge networking no longer bypasses them. If UFW is active on the box and port 26656 is not explicitly allowed for the Tailscale range (`100.64.0.0/10`), P2P connections will silently fail even though `ss -tlnp` shows the port is listening. The fix: `sudo ufw allow from 100.64.0.0/10 to any port 26656 proto tcp`. See `references/native-cometbft-operations.md` for full details.
- **SSH host key mismatch across interfaces:** A node reachable via both LAN and Tailscale may have different host keys. Use `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null` when switching between interfaces, or maintain separate `Host` entries in `~/.ssh/config` for LAN vs Tailscale paths.
- **Multi-box per operator onboarding (Adgas pattern):** When one operator (e.g. Adgas) deploys multiple validators on separate HyperAIBoxes, each box has its own Tailscale IP and moniker. The onboarding cascade is: (1) operator deploys all boxes with correct moniker + persistent peers, (2) operator shares all boxes to the coordinator's tailnet, (3) coordinator updates ALL existing validators' `.env` to include the new boxes, (4) coordinator shares all existing validators to the operator's tailnet so new boxes can dial back, (5) each new box verifies `n_peers = N-1`. The `BATTERYAGI_PERSISTENT_PEERS` on existing nodes must include ALL new IPs, not just one.
- **Maia `connected=False` diagnostic:** When a newly-added validator shows `connected=False` for one peer only while other peers show `connected=True`, the root cause is almost always that the new validator's `.env` contains the wrong IP for that one peer (cross-tailnet IP mismatch). Check `tailscale status` on the problematic box to get the correct local-tailnet IP for the unreachable peer. Never accept IPs from another operator's tailnet as authoritative.
- **Full mesh restart after box outage:** When a validator box reboots or loses network (e.g. R2-D2 went offline for 1h), after it comes back online it will automatically rejoin the mesh because all surviving nodes still have it in their persistent_peers. No `.env` updates are needed for recovery — just verify `n_peers` returns to N-1.
- **Commented `#PasswordAuthentication` default:** Ubuntu's default sshd_config has `#PasswordAuthentication yes` (commented). The `#` means the system default applies (usually `yes`). You must explicitly write `PasswordAuthentication no` and restart sshd — merely uncommenting is not enough. See `references/batteryagi-pre-upgrade-readiness.md`.
- **Box on wrong subnet after reboot:** If a HyperAIBox was manually connected to a different network and then rebooted, it may not come back on the expected LAN IP. Verify the physical ethernet connection, check `arp -a` on the local router, and if needed move the cable back to the correct subnet. This happened to R2-D2 in 2026-07-20 — it was on a different subnet for ~1 day until the cable was moved back.
- **Tailscale `active` vs `offline` after reboot:** After a full reboot, Tailscale may show `offline` for 1–2 minutes while the daemon initializes. Wait for `active` before declaring the check complete. ARM64 HyperAIBoxes can take 2–5 minutes total to boot.
- **SD card corruption after power outage on RK3588:** RK3588 HyperAIBoxes use SD cards as primary storage. A power cut can corrupt the filesystem, causing CometBFT to panic with `input/output error` on blockstore.db files. Symptoms: `EXT4-fs error` in dmesg, `pebble: backing file error` in CometBFT logs, inability to read/write to `/storage` directory. Recovery: (1) stop CometBFT, (2) remove corrupted data symlink, (3) restore from `~/.batterycoin-comet/data.rootdisk-backup` (pre-ceremony snapshot at height ~12,844) to home dir, (4) restart and resync. Do NOT attempt to write to `/storage` after corruption — the SD card is failing. Use home dir directly until SD card is replaced. Keep `data.rootdisk-backup` preserved at all times — it is the only fallback.
- **Auto-restart cron essential for power outage resilience:** Add `@reboot` cron entry for tmux-based CometBFT auto-start. After a power outage, boxes will boot and automatically restart the validator. Without this, the node stays offline until manual intervention.
- **Health monitoring cron for fleet visibility:** Set up a 3-hourly cron job that polls both nodes' RPC status, checks height, catching_up, peer count, and disk usage. This provides early warning before a node fails completely.
- **Reconnected box is stuck at old height (3+ hours behind):** When a box comes back after being offline for hours, its CometBFT process may still be running (if started via `nohup`). However, it will be **stuck at the old height** with `catching_up: false` and a stale `latest_block_time`. It will NOT automatically catch up. CometBFT only re-discovers the live chain tip after a restart. **Always restart the reconnected box's CometBFT process** (one at a time), then verify `catching_up: true` appears and `latest_block_time` becomes current. Do not trust `catching_up: false` on a reconnected box without checking `latest_block_time` against wall-clock.
- **Symmetric offline cycling (physical unplugging):** When a fleet consists of boxes on the same physical LAN, the user may unplug one to plug in another (same power outlet / same attention window). When a user says "try again, I reconnected it," always check the **FULL mesh** immediately — not just the reconnected box. The box that was online before may now be offline. Report full mesh status: which boxes are reachable vs unreachable.
